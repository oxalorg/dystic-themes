Cooking or cookery is the art, technology and craft of
preparing food for consumption with the use of heat. Cooking
techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world, from
grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves,
to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting unique
environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends.
The ways or types of cooking also depend on the skill and type
of training an individual cook has. Cooking is done both by
people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and
chefs in restaurants and other food establishments. Cooking
can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence
of heat, most notably with ceviche, a traditional South
American dish where fish is cooked with the acids in lemon or
lime juice.
